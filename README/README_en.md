## 💻 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 (Basic functionality probably works on Linux/Mac as well)
- NVIDIA GPU (RTX 30/40/50 series recommended, minimum 8GB VRAM)
- CUDA Toolkit 12.6 (CUDA 12.8 recommended for RTX 50 series)
- Python 3.10.x
- Latest NVIDIA GPU drivers

#### 📍 For RTX 50 Series (Blackwell) Users

RTX 50 series (RTX 5070Ti, RTX 5080, RTX 5090, etc.) requires special setup:

- **CUDA**: 12.8 or later required
- **PyTorch**: 2.7.0 (CUDA 12.8 compatible)
- **SageAttention**: 2.1.1 (RTX 50 series optimized)
- **Recommended Setup**: Please refer to [detailed setup instructions](README_setup_en.md#rtx-50-series-blackwell-setup)

Note: Linux compatibility was enhanced in v1.2 with additional open features, but some functionality may be limited.

### Instructions

#### Installing the Official Package

First, you need to install the original FramePack.

1. Download the Windows one-click installer from the [official FramePack](https://github.com/lllyasviel/FramePack?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
   Click "Click Here to Download One-Click Package (CUDA 12.6 + Pytorch 2.6)".

2. Extract the downloaded package, run `update.bat`, and then start with `run.bat`.
   Running `update.bat` is important. If you don't do this, you'll be using an earlier version with potential bugs not fixed.

3. Necessary models will be automatically downloaded during the first launch (approximately 30GB).
   If you already have downloaded models, place them in the `framepack\webui\hf_download` folder.
   Download progress for each model is displayed; please wait for completion.

4. At this point, it will work, but processing will be slower if acceleration libraries (Xformers, Flash Attn, Sage Attn) are not installed.
   ```
   Currently enabled native sdp backends: ['flash', 'math', 'mem_efficient', 'cudnn']
   Xformers is not installed!
   Flash Attn is not installed!
   Sage Attn is not installed!
   ```
   
   Processing time difference: (with RAM: 32GB, RTX 4060Ti (16GB))
   - Without libraries: about 4 minutes 46 seconds/25 steps
   - With libraries installed: about 3 minutes 17 seconds to 3 minutes 25 seconds/25 steps

5. To install acceleration libraries, download `package_installer.zip` from [Issue #138](https://github.com/lllyasviel/FramePack/issues/138), extract it, and run `package_installer.bat` in the root directory (press Enter in the command prompt).

6. Start again and confirm that the libraries are installed:
   ```
   Currently enabled native sdp backends: ['flash', 'math', 'mem_efficient', 'cudnn']
   Xformers is installed!
   Flash Attn is not installed!
   Sage Attn is installed!
   ```
   When the author ran it, Flash Attn was not installed.
   Note: Even without Flash Attn installed, there is little impact on processing speed. According to test results, the speed difference with or without Flash Attn is minimal, and even with "Flash Attn is not installed!" the processing speed is about 3 minutes 17 seconds/25 steps, almost equivalent to having all installations (about 3 minutes 25 seconds/25 steps).
   Xformers likely has the biggest impact.

   - **For experienced users wanting detailed control**: Use the standard model (`run_endframe_ichi.bat`)

2. **Model Characteristics**:
   - **F1 Model**: Forward generation, more dynamic movement, simpler operation
   - **Standard Model**: Reverse generation, precise control, feature-rich

### Basic Video Generation

1. **Upload Image**: Upload an image to the "Image" frame
2. **Enter Prompt**: Enter a prompt expressing the character's movement
3. **Adjust Settings**: Set video length and seed value
4. **Start Generation**: Click the "Start Generation" button

### F1 Model Specific Settings (v1.9.1)

- **Image Influence**: Adjust the degree of change in the first section (100.0% to 102.0%)
- **Prompt**: Emphasize movement descriptions in prompts for better results
- **Note**: Section settings and Final Frame features are not available in the F1 model

### Standard Model Advanced Settings

- **Generation Mode Selection**:
  - **Normal Mode**: General video generation
  - **Loop Mode**: Generate cyclic videos where the final frame returns to the first frame

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Localhost Accessibility Error

When starting FramePack-eichi, you may encounter the following error:

```
localhost is not accessible
```

**Cause**: Gradio performs a localhost accessibility check with a 3-second timeout during startup. FramePack-eichi, having more UI components than standard FramePack, may exceed this time limit.

**Solutions**:

#### 1. Extend Timeout Settings (Recommended)

This method solves the problem at its root by changing the localhost check timeout from 3 seconds to 10 seconds.

1. Open the file `[FramePackFolder]\system\python\Lib\site-packages\gradio\networking.py`
2. Find line around 68 (look for `r = httpx.head(url, timeout=3, verify=False)`)
3. Change `timeout=3` to `timeout=10`

```python
# Change line 68
r = httpx.head(url, timeout=10, verify=False)
```

#### 2. VSCode Terminal Startup

VSCode may start faster, potentially allowing the check to complete within the 3-second rule.

1. Open VSCode
2. Open the FramePack folder
3. Open terminal (Ctrl+`)
4. Run the startup command

```bash
run_endframe_ichi.bat
```

#### 3. Increase Virtual Memory

Increasing virtual memory can improve response times and satisfy the 3-second rule.

1. Control Panel → System → Advanced System Settings
2. Under the "Advanced" tab, click "Settings" in the Performance section
3. "Advanced" tab → "Change" in the Virtual Memory section
4. Increase the paging file size (recommended: 2-3 times the RAM size)

#### 4. Use --share Option (Temporary Solution)

This method bypasses the localhost accessibility check but creates a public URL.

1. Open the corresponding .bat file in a text editor
2. Add `--share` to the command line

```bash
python webui/endframe_ichi.py --share
```

**Important Notes about --share**:
- Creates a public URL accessible from the Internet (valid for 72 hours)
- Recommended for use only in secure environments
- Not recommended for long-term use due to security considerations
- Use only as a temporary measure

### About h11 Errors

When starting the tool and importing images for the first time, you may encounter numerous errors like the following:
(Errors appear in the console, and images do not display in the GUI)

**In most cases, the images are actually uploaded, but the thumbnail display fails. You can still proceed with video generation.**

![FramePack-eichi Error Screen 1](../images/framepack_eichi_error_screenshot1.png)
```
ERROR:    Exception in ASGI application
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\xxx\xxx\framepack\system\python\lib\site-packages\uvicorn\protocols\http\h11_impl.py", line 404, in run_asgi
```
This error appears when there's an issue during HTTP response processing.
As mentioned above, it frequently occurs during the initial startup phase when Gradio hasn't finished starting up.

Solutions:
1. Delete the image using the "×" button and re-upload it.
2. If the same file repeatedly fails:
   - Completely stop the Python process and restart the application
   - Restart your PC and then restart the application

If errors persist, try other image files or reduce the image size.

### Memory Shortage Errors

If "CUDA out of memory" or "RuntimeError: CUDA error" appears:

1. Increase the `gpu_memory_preservation` value (e.g., 12-16GB)
2. Close other applications using the GPU
3. Restart and try again
4. Reduce image resolution (around 640x640 recommended)

### Detailed Memory Consumption Analysis

Based on detailed analysis of the entire source code, actual memory consumption is as follows:

#### Basic Model Configuration and Load-Time Memory Consumption

- **transformer** (FramePackI2V_HY): Approximately 25-30GB (when state dictionary is fully expanded)
- **text_encoder**, **text_encoder_2**, **vae** total: Approximately 8-10GB
  v1.9.1 adds unload processing to reduce RAM usage
- **Other auxiliary models** (image_encoder, etc.): About 3-5GB
- **Total baseline RAM consumption**: About 36-45GB

#### Memory Consumption Pattern During LoRA Application

LoRA application processing flow:
1. **Original state dictionary**: About 25-30GB (transformer size)
2. **LoRA file loading**: 50MB to 500MB
3. **During merge processing**: Temporarily requires an additional 25-30GB as it duplicates the original state dictionary while merging with LoRA
   Note: v1.9.1 revises this process, significantly reducing RAM consumption
4. **Peak during application process**: Basic consumption + state dictionary duplication ≈ about 70-90GB

**Important**: This significant memory consumption increase occurs only during the initial LoRA loading. When loading a different LoRA file or changing LoRA application strength or FP8 settings, such large memory peaks do not occur. For normal video generation operations after the initial load, memory usage remains at the basic consumption level (around 36-45GB).

#### Recommended System Requirements

- **Standard execution RAM requirement**: 36-45GB
- **Temporary peak during LoRA application**: 70-90GB
- **Recommended total memory**: Combined RAM + pagefile should be at least 40GB
  
For example:
- 32GB RAM system → Set pagefile to approximately 40GB
- 64GB RAM system → Set pagefile to approximately 20GB

#### Additional Memory Requirements When Using the F1 Model

When using the F1 model, the following additional memory is required on top of the standard model:
- **F1 model initial download**: About 24GB
- **Storage capacity when both models coexist**: About 54GB

#### Note for No-Swap Environments like Google Colab

Running in environments without swap memory has very strict limitations:
- RAM limits (13-15GB) make it difficult to load even the basic model
- Cannot handle the temporary memory peak of 70-90GB required during LoRA application
- Without swap, the system crashes immediately with OOM errors when memory is insufficient

### Video Display Issues

There are issues with videos not displaying in some browsers (especially Firefox) and macOS:

- Symptoms: Video doesn't display in Gradio UI, thumbnails don't display in Windows, can't play in some players
- Cause: Video codec setting issue in `\framepack\webui\diffusers_helper\utils.py`

**This issue has been resolved by merging the MP4 Compression feature from the original project**

### Docker-Specific Troubleshooting

When using the Docker container:

1. **GPU Not Detected**: 
   - Ensure NVIDIA Container Toolkit is installed
   - Verify your GPU is compatible (minimum 8GB VRAM)
   - Check that the driver in your docker-compose.yml matches your installed NVIDIA driver

2. **Container Crashes on Start**:
   - Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs`
   - Ensure your system has enough disk space for the models (~30GB)
   - Verify host system has sufficient RAM (minimum 16GB recommended)

3. **Access Issues**:
   - Make sure port 7861 is not being used by another application
   - Try accessing with http://localhost:7861 (not https)
   - If using a remote system, ensure the firewall allows access to port 7861
